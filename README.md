# Pocket-VNA

The application is still in development! Feel free to help us.

We have been developing in parallel with the app a library to read and process **Touchstone files** called **sXp-to-json**,
fell free to check it out here [https://github.com/joaompsantos/sXp-to-json/tree/dev](https://github.com/joaompsantos/sXp-to-json/tree/dev) if you need a library with features like this (it isn't in npm yet).

## To run

You must have **npm** and **yarn** installed.

```bash
>> git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/dvcorreia/pocket-vna.git
>> cd pocket-vna
>> yarn start
```
