## Status

__The application development was dropped!__ Feel free grab the project for developent.
The development idea stoped when was decided to drop the dependency of the front-end logic library (sXp-to-json) and make a server for it.

We have been developing in parallel with the app a library to read and process **Touchstone files** called **sXp-to-json**,
fell free to check it out here [https://github.com/joaompsantos/sXp-to-json/tree/dev](https://github.com/joaompsantos/sXp-to-json/tree/dev).
